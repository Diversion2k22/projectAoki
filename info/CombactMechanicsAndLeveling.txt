The game will have a traditional JRPG styled turn based combat which will be based on exploiting the enemies weakness to certain spells and elements, the combat will be designed to be a little brutal and unforgiving for the mistakes of the player, though there will be different difficulty settings so that the player can enjoy the story regardless. The game will also typical level based mechanics, the player will gain experience as they defeat more enemies, however enemies is a particular area will be scaled to the level of the party members and player so that it does not suffer from the game becoming too easy due to grinding. As for the levelling system, in a nutshell in order to program, we will define current level, current experience and experience required to go to 
next level we will then have a constructor and a function to add experience. This will be the basic logic which will be executed. As to make combat a bit interesting and different from other similar type of games we will include a mood meter which will increase or decrease the stats and unlock special moves depending upon the mood of the player which will further be determined by the number of monsters/creatures that the player defeats or decides to spare. A bad mood isn’t necessarily bad as it can also unlock some special moves despite worsening the stats. Also, there will be a health system which will be just like any other game nothing too significant.
