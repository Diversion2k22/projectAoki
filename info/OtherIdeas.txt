Here, we want to discuss some ideas that we want to include in our game “Project Aoki”.
Many JRPGs suffer from the fact that things get tedious and monotonous after a while, in order to avoid that we will try to design as many unique characters and enemies possible and also include at least 3 mini games within the games so that the player never feels there are too little things to do. Also, there will two different playable regions which being the real world and the whitespace, the player will be able to interact with people in the real world as well. However, if we do get enough time we will try to make a third area in which the player will be able to reflect upon the choices made by them in the game, in other words, they will get to interact with monsters/creatures depending upon whether they spared them or killed them. Over here, the player will also be able to talk the party members and strengthen their bond with them which will provide a boost in combat though nothing major.
There will also different elements that enemies will be weak/resistant against depending upon their elements, it will help keep the combat fresh and non repetitive. The player will also be able to purchase and sell equipment which will aid them in combat. Also, instead of fighting these creatures the player will also be able to negotiate and talk with them and different enemies will have different types of nature, it will be easy to convince some enemies to talk while it will difficult to convince others.
